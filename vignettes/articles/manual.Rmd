## Intro

Here we will show visually what each transformation does using the rgl package. In all visualisations, blue represents the original vector/position and Red represents the new vector/position.


## Basic Transformations
```{r}
v <- c(1, 0, 0)
axis <- c(0, 0, 1)
angle <- pi/2  # 90 degrees in radians

v_new <- rotate_vector_around_axis(v, axis, angle)

# Draw original vec
clear3d()
decorate3d()
arrow3d(p0 = zero, p1 = v, color="blue", type = "rotation")
arrow3d(p0 = zero, p1 = v_new, color="red", type = "rotation")
arrow3d(p0 = zero, p1 = axis, color="purple", type = "rotation")
arc3d(from = v/3, to = v_new/3, center = zero, color="green", lwd = 5)
text3d(x = (v + v_new)/6, texts = radians_to_degrees(angle))
# vectors3d
rglwidget()
```
