\title{Compute signed angle between two planes}
\usage{
measure_signed_angle_between_planes(n1, n2, ref_axis, degrees = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{n1, n2}{Numeric vectors (length 3) giving the normal vectors of the planes.}

\item{ref_axis}{Numeric vector (length 3); defines the positive rotation direction
according to the right-hand rule.}

\item{degrees}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, return the angle in degrees (default).}
}
\value{
A numeric scalar giving the signed angle between the two planes.
}
\description{
Calculates the signed angle between two planes given their normal vectors.
The sign is determined by the right-hand rule about the specified reference
axis, allowing differentiation between clockwise and counter-clockwise
rotations. Returns an angle in degrees by default.
}
\details{
The function computes an oriented angle in the range \eqn{(-180, 180]} using
\code{atan2}, with the rotation direction determined by the \code{ref_axis}.
This is useful in geometric or molecular contexts (e.g., dihedral angles)
where distinguishing rotation sense is important.

\examples{
n1 <- c(0, 0, 1)
n2 <- c(0, 1, 0)
measure_signed_angle_between_planes(n1, n2, ref_axis = c(1, 0, 0))
