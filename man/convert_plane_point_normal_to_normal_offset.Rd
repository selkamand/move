\title{Convert a plane from (point, normal) to (unit normal, offset)}
\usage{
convert_plane_point_normal_to_normal_offset(normal, point)
}
\arguments{
\item{normal}{Numeric vector of length 3 — the plane's normal (does not need to be unit length).}

\item{point}{Numeric vector of length 3 — a known point lying on the plane.}
}
\value{
A list with:
\describe{
\item{normal}{Unit normal vector (length 3).}
\item{offset}{Signed distance from the origin along the normal.}
}
}
\description{
Converts a plane defined by a point lying on it and a (possibly non-unit) normal
into an equivalent representation defined by a \strong{unit normal} and a \strong{signed offset}
along that normal.
}
\details{
The plane is expressed in \strong{Hesse normal form}:
\deqn{\hat{n} \cdot x = s}
where \eqn{\hat{n}} is a unit normal vector and \eqn{s} is the signed distance
from the origin to the plane along \eqn{\hat{n}}.

The offset is computed as \eqn{s = \hat{n} \cdot p}, where \eqn{p} is the supplied point
and \eqn{\hat{n}} = \eqn{normal / ||normal||}.
Positive values of \code{offset} mean the plane lies in the direction of the normal
from the origin.

\examples{
convert_plane_point_normal_to_normal_offset(c(0, 0, 2), c(2, 3, 5))
# $normal = c(0, 0, 1)
# $offset = 5

# Relationship with rgl::planes3d():
x <- convert_plane_point_normal_to_normal_offset(c(1, 0, 0), c(3, 0, 0))
# rgl::planes3d(a = x$normal[1], b = x$normal[2], c = x$normal[3], d = -x$offset)
