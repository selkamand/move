\title{Measure the distance between two points}
\usage{
measure_distance_between_two_points(a, b)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{Numeric vector giving the first point.}

\item{b}{Numeric vector giving the second point.}
}
\value{
A numeric scalar giving the Euclidean distance between
\code{a} and \code{b}.
}
\description{
Computes the Euclidean distance between two points by taking the
magnitude of the difference vector (\code{b - a}).
